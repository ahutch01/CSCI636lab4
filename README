I came across an error I couldn't solve, not sure how I would change the training data to better fit 

Line of code that has the error:

x_train, x_test, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 42)

Error Statement:
Found input variables with inconsistent numbers of samples: [891, 2]
